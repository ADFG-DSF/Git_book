# Preface {.unnumbered}

The author is aware that each analyst has a unique level of expertise and each analysis has unique requirements. As the analyist it is up to you to use professional judgment to decide which techniques are useful for the analysis you are conducting. That said, we offer the following general advice.

-   As a best practice documents describe appropriate practices for the largest, most complex analysis you are likely to face. If you project is simple, the overhead associated with these techniques may not be justified. Use your professional judgement to discern how to follow the spirit of reproducible research while modifing this guidance to specific situations you encounter. The author understands that and applies similar discretion his work.

-   This document represent the collective experience of XX years of work at ADF&G. Our vision is that this is guidance will be followed closely if you have minimal prior experience. Younger employees introducing and adopting modern research practices is one of the key ways a large agency can keep current over time. We recognize seasoned employees have reproducible workflows they are happy with and may be hesitant to learn new techniques. We would encourage those employees to try some of these techniques on new projects and to migrate existing projects at opportune times and/or prior to transiting a project to an different analyst.

## Division of Sport Fish Github Transition

Biometricans with ADF&G Sport fish will be required to store their analysis on github starting in 2024. This means that all operations plans and reports published in 2024 and later will be required to reference a github site and a specific commit where the published analysis is stored. This decision was reached by a consensus of Biometrican IIIs and will streamline final biometric reviews and transitioning projects between biometrics staff. This document was produced to help provide guidance for satisfying this requirement.
