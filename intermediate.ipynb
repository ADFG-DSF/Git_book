        "\n",
        "Intermediate Git workflows introduce some a new concept: branches. Efficient use of branches and a well thought out branching strategy will aid the analyst in Git use and is also a powerful tool for model development.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Branches and Branch strategy\n",
        "\n",
        "In Git a branch is a pointer to a specific commit or set of commits which allow you to separate model development tasks into individual work units. Everything I know about branching I learned from [this guy](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and in what follows I will simplify his workflow into something that works well for complicated fisheries analyses. Let's start by creating a new branch named develop using the command `git checkout`. The argument `-b` tells Git to checkout a new branch while the arguments `develop` and `main` tell Git the name of the new branch and that the new branch should branch from the `main` branch.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```{default}\n",
        "amreimer@DFGSXQDSF206801 MINGW64 /s/RTS/Reimer/Research_Best_Practices/git_practice (main)\n",
        "$ git checkout -b develop main\n",
        "Switched to a new branch 'develop'\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The core concept in the Git Flow branching strategy is to always have two active branches; `main` and `develop`. The `main` branch is stable in that you make limited commits to it and those commits are associated with internal or external reporting; including FDS reports, BOF memos or work sessions, or conference presentations. Because the `main` branch will largely be static interested collaborators can quickly identify the analysis at the time periods where the analysis was reported.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `develop` branch is the working branch and will have frequent commits relative to analysis progress. The `develop` branch merges into `main` during reporting periods and is the branched from whenever a new feature is being developed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Feature branches are created frequently as new features are envisioned and developed. A best practice is to create a new feature branch, with a descriptive name, every time your create a new feature. When the feature is completed it is merged back into develop, left as a record without a merge, or deleted. In my work, feature branches are mostly merged back into develop, and this occurs whenever I create a feature which improves the analysis. Feature branches are left unmerged when I want to retain a record of having tried something (and the result) but do not think it improves the overall analysis. Feature branches are deleted without merging when something just did not work out and is also not worth retaining as a record.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's practice Git Flow. In the terminal session which follows we: create a new branch called `cleanup` with `git checkout`, modify the file `fib_seq.R` by deleting several lines, show the changes using `git diff`, add those changes, and commit those changes.\n",

You can specify the appropriate commit with a absolute or relative reference. For an absolute reference provide the SHA #. For a relative reference the shorthand is HEAD\\~# where \\# is the number of commits prior to the latest commit. In the terminal sequence below I used checkout to retrieve a copy of `fib_seq.R` from 1 commit earlier (recall this commit had the less informative x and y axis labels). Notice the earlier version of `fib_seq.R` was present in my working directory (as shown in the output for `cat`) but was not included in the latest commit to my repository (as shown in the output to `git show`). If I wanted the earlier version of `fib_seq.R` to be associated with the most recent commit to my repository I would need to stage and commit the file. In this case I did not want to change my repository so I used `git checkout` to go back the the most recent version. I often use this sequence to recall all or part of a code from a prior commit.\n",
