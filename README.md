# Git_book
A Quarto Book describing best practices for Git use at ADF&amp;G

A short book designed to help Division of Sport Fisheries Biometricans and Quantitative Biologist use Git and GitHub. The book was motivated by the gluttony of Git installation instructions and programmer specific Git content that is available online with seemingly sparse layman level instructions for how to use Git one it is installed. This book is intended to make sure ADF&G has a record of technical analysis carried out by staff, increase knowledge transfer between both contemporaneous and succeeding staff, and improve overall reproducible research practices within the Division.
