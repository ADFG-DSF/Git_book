That said, utilizing Git comes with an overhead that may not be justified for small projects unless you consider collaboration with future analysts including yourself. To demonstrate Git's collaborative potential I created a remote repository on GitHub called git_practice.\n\n### Interacting with your Remote Repository\n\n#### git push\n\nTo link your local repository to a remote repository use `git remote`. In the terminal session below I added a remote repository named \"origin\" and provided a url where the repository is located. The second command created a new branch in the remote named `main`. The third command \"pushed\" my local repository to my remote repository. Files associated with this repository are now stored in a location where they can be accessed by others for viewing, download, or collaborative work.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.default .cell-code}\namreimer@DFGSXQDSF223076 MINGW64 /s/RTS/Reimer/Research_Best_Practices/git_practice ({main})\n$ git remote add origin https://github.com/adamreimer/git_practice.git\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.default .cell-code}\namreimer@DFGSXQDSF223076 MINGW64 /s/RTS/Reimer/Research_Best_Practices/git_practice ({main})\n$ git branch -M main\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.default .cell-code}\namreimer@DFGSXQDSF223076 MINGW64 /s/RTS/Reimer/Research_Best_Practices/git_practice (main)\n$ git push -u origin main\nEnumerating objects: 11, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (11/11), done.\nDelta compression using up to 16 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (11/11), 1.53 KiB | 8.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 11 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nremote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), done.\nTo https://github.com/adamreimer/git_practice.git\n * [new branch]      main -> main\nbranch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter pushing to github your repository now looks like @fig-push.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The Git workspace after your local repository has been pushed to a remote repository.](collaboration_files/figure-html/fig-push-1.png){#fig-push width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have a remote repository updated we have to worry about keeping them both synced. To illustrate this workflow I'll change the `fib_seq.r` file by adding the fifth value to the Fibonacci sequence (`fib_seq[5] <- fib_seq[3] + fib_seq[4]`) as a new line. After this change the git work space will contain an unstaged change which is not reflected in either repository.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The Git workspace after the working directory has been changed leaving the local and remote repositories out-of-date.](collaboration_files/figure-html/fig-changewremote-1.png){#fig-changewremote width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the terminal session below I stage the file `fib_seq.R` and commit the file.

Finally, `git pull` brings the local repository on the S drive into sync with the remote.

We will discuss three typical use cases below.\n\n#### git clone - To Copy/Modify Code\n\nImagine a situation where a peer has written some code which you would like to modify for a similar project[^collaboration-2]. Use `git clone` as described above. You will be able to create a copy of their repository and work on your local machine as usual, but you will not be able to push changes back to the remote.\n\n[^collaboration-2]: Common courtesy requires you to ask permission and credit the person who originally wrote the code.\n\n#### git clone, git push, git pull - To Collaborate (closely)\n\nIf you and a peer are working closely on an analysis it may be appropriate for the owner to add their peer as a collaborator to the project. This is a point-and-click task from your github repository page, *Settings\\>Collaborators\\>Add people\\>(keypunch the username*). The collaborator can push and pull changes to the remote as if they were the owner. This arrangement is only appropriate for peers who you trust to commit changes of which you both approve. In practice, this likely means there will be personal communication to coordinate each person's efforts. To demonstrate this process I added my wife (Carly) as a collaborator to the git_practice repository. Carly then cloned the repository, modified the `fib_seq.R` file by adding a new line (`fib_seq[7] <- fib_seq[5] + fib_seq[6]`), staged the file, committed the changes, and pushed her local repository back to the git_practice remote. Afterwards I pulled those changes back to the local repository on my S drive. The terminal sessions and figures associated with these actions would closely mirror those shown for `git clone`, `git push`, and `git pull` above although the local repositories have different owners in this case. To demonstrate commits were made by both collaborators I ran a specially formatted call[^collaboration-3] to `git log` which shows that the latest commit to this repository did come form a new author.\n\n[^collaboration-3]: Thanks [Jesper Rønn-Jensen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1441010/the-shortest-possible-output-from-git-log-containing-author-and-date)! Note: %h specifies the short commit ID, %x09 specifies a tab, %an specifies the author, %ad specifies the commit date, and %s specifies the commit title.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.default .cell-code}\namreimer@DFGSXQDSF223076 MINGW64 /s/RTS/Reimer/Research_Best_Practices/git_practice (main)\n$ git log --pretty=format:\"%h%x09%an%x09%ad%x09%s\"\nf732cdb Carly Reimer    Sun Jul 2 22:01:17 2023 -0800   Seventh Fibonacci number\n9db5478 Adam Reimer     Sun Jul 2 20:39:19 2023 -0800   Sixth number in the Fibonacci seqence\n5139049 Adam Reimer     Sun Jul 2 16:15:52 2023 -0800   Fifth entry in the Fibonacci sequence\n0c92881 Adam Reimer     Sun Jul 2 14:53:05 2023 -0800   Fourth entry in the Fibonacci sequence\n3bb6c98 Adam Reimer     Sun Jul 2 14:31:04 2023 -0800   Third entry in fib_seq\ne17181f Adam Reimer     Sun Jul 2 12:59:06 2023 -0800   Initialize Fibonacci sequence\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### fork - To Collaborate (formally)\n\n[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) is a GitHub operation which creates a copy of another user's remote repository under your GitHub ID. After the fork is created you can clone it to a local repository as described above. Your local repository can be [configured](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#configuring-git-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-upstream-repository) to [sync](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) with the original (upstream) repository so that your local repository can track changes the original author made after fork. If you make significant changes to the repository that the original author may be interested in you can submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) which notifies the original author about the changes you have made and gives them the opportunity to include your code in the repository. Github has great documentation of this process.\n\nAs an example I revoked my wife's collaborator status on the git_practice repository associated with my GitHub account. Carly then forked the git_practice repository in my account. Afterwards, the forked version of the git_practice repository in her account looked something like this:\n\n![The forked git_practice repository in Carly Reimer's GitHub account](forked_repository.png)\n\nUsing the same commands described above, Carly cloned the forked repository, made changes, added the changed file, committed the changes, and pushed the result back to her forked repository on Github. Pull requests are so named because Carly is asking me to pull her forked repository back into my original repository. To initiate a pull request the owner of the forked repository (Carly) navigates to the original repository and presses the *Pull request* button. The pull request looked like this when viewed from my account:\n\n![The pull request summary screen.](pull_request_AR.PNG)\n\nNavigating the the *Files changed* button allows the repository owner to review line by line changes associated with the pull request. In this case, I deemed the suggestions reasonable and accepted them without comment but there are capabilities to comments and modify the changes before they are accepted.\n\n![The pull request review/approval screen](pull_request_AR_approve.PNG)\n\nAfter the request is approved the original owner can merge the pull request from within GitHub.\n\n![Merging a pull request](pull_request_AR_merge.PNG)\n\nAfter merging the pull request; Carly's local repository, the forked repository, and the original remote repository are synced while Adam's local repository is behind. This situation could be fixed with `git pull`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.default .cell-code}\namreimer@DFGSXQDSF206801 MINGW64 /s/RTS/Reimer/Research_Best_Practices/git_practice (main)\n$ git pull\nremote: Enumerating objects: 12, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (12/12), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (7/7), done.\nremote: Total 10 (delta 3), reused 9 (delta 3), pack-reused 0\nUnpacking objects: 100% (10/10), 2.60 KiB | 1024 bytes/s, done.\nFrom https://github.com/adamreimer/git_practice\n   f732cdb..22dcfea  main       -> origin/main\nUpdating f732cdb..22dcfea\nFast-forward\n fib_seq.R | 8 ++++++--\n 1 file changed, 6 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)\n```\n:::\n",
