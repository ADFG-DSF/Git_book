# only hear to trick quarto into using the knitr engine.
# I cant figure out how to specify that in settings for a book.
# Could rename this file to .Rmd (*and rename the refernece in _quarto.yml but then footnots are disable for some strange reason.)

I get it, everyone is tired and I have beat this subject to death. Still, we should tidy up before we close the git_practice repository for an extended amount of time. The repository may or may not have any enduring value but it helped me get through this book. As such the the repository might be about to go public. That being the case the Git Flow workflow suggests we: merge `develop` back into `main`, tag the published version, and push the published version to the remote. Lets do that to close out.
